# Simple LP1 Codes
This is a repo that provides simple versions of LP1 codes. Codes will be uploaded as practiced(by me)


Left:
1) mpi Breadth First search
2) OpenMP Merge sort
3) Alpha Beta pruning
4) Hadoop

(Some other codes are very trivial to implement and are almost repetitve, hence left out)
